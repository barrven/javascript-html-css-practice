This app should be able to emulate children's building blocks in 2D

Container that represents space in which blocks can be clicked and dragged around by the use.
Blocks should be stackable and not occupy the same space as each other. 

There should be a button to add more blocks and a dropdown menu to choose which type of block to add.

Types of blocks are different shapes like triangles, circles, etc.

## Attack plan:

- get click and drag working
- detect edges and other blocks

Detect edges of container was easy but other blocks is much harder.
It's also difficult to make it fail gracefully and consistently

Putting collision detection for other blocks on hold for now. 

Added user control of block color and size, as well as button to add more blocks.

Want method to select blocks. and method to delete them.
